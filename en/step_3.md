## Choose a theme

In this step, you will choose a theme for your 3D scene.

--- task ---

In the example below, the theme is of a city at night-time. It creates an eerie mood, with the moon shining a dim light over the houses. A bat flies in the sky and far away, a dog bark can be heard. 

Use the `speed`{:class="block3variables"} slider to change the speed that the bat flies at.

Open a new Scratch project.

**Online:** open a new online Scratch project at [scratch.mit.edu](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor){:target="_blank"}.

**Offline:** open a new project in the Scratch offline editor. If you need to, you can [download and install Scratch here](https://scratch.mit.edu/download){:target="_blank"}.

To decide on the theme for your project, try to answer the following questions. Keep your ideas simple for now. You can always add more detail later.
+ What mood do you want to create? Will it be relaxing, energising, or funny?
+ What will your scenery look like?
+ What backdrop and sprites will you include in your 3D scene?
+ What sound(s) will you include?
+ What will the user be able to control with sliders?

Give your project a name that matches your theme and save it. Remember to check **Information** when you need help.

Go to **File** in the menu. If you have a Scratch account, click on **Save now**. If you do not have an account, click on **Save to your computer**.

Click in the project name box and change the name to match your project.

If you share your project, then other people will also see this name, so make sure that it makes sense.

In the next four steps, you will create your scenery and add 3D effects to enhance the appearance of depth. You will add sounds and include a variable slider so that the user can interact with your project. Make sure that you have enough time for each of these steps so that your project includes some sound and a controller.
