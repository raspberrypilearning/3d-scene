## Add more

--- task ---
Now that you have got your project to work the way that you want it to, you could add more `layers`{:class="block3looks"} to your 3D scenery.

If you only used backdrops and sprites from the Scratch Libraries, then you could use the Paint editor to create some of your own scenery. 

You could also add more `sound effects`{:class="block3sound"} and `variables`{:class="block3variables"}.

**Tip:** Professional programmers explore and take inspiration from code created by other programmers.

You may want to investigate the example projects in **step 2: Get inspiration**.

Take a look at some 3D scene projects created by community members, which you can explore in the Raspberry Pi Foundationâ€™s studio of 3D Scene Community Projects  [See inside](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/28115978){:target="_blank"}.
